# Hooks Directory

All custom React hooks go here.

## Rules
- All hooks must start with `use` prefix
- All hooks must be named exports
- Import React as `import * as React from 'react'`

## Example
```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

export const useToggle = (initialValue = false) => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(initialValue);
  const toggle = React.useCallback(() => setValue(v => !v), []);
  return [value, toggle] as const;
};
```
